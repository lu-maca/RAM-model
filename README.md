# RAM-model

simple and probably not very accurate model of a RAM

## Run
Run the command:
``` bash
./run.sh ALGORITHM_PATH INPUT_STRING
```

For example:
``` bash
./run.sh examples/max_number.txt "3556732 "
```
will return `[Result] 7`.

You can also run with python:
``` bash
python src/computer.py examples/max_number.txt "3556732 "
```
